<h2>I BUILD COOL THINGS <span class="responsive-line-break">ON THE WEB</span></h2>

My career as a software engineer began in 1996, but my experience with the web goes back to 1994 when I started building "home pages" of the era.

Since those early days, some of the web applications I've built include a knowledge base for GoldMine Software, accounting and reconcilliation systems for GMAC Residential Captial Group, a youth team sports registration system for the Active Network, systems to allow automotive mechanics to quickly access vehicular diagnostic and repair information for Mitchell 1, an online textbook reader for BridgePoint Education, and time share management software for ResortCom.

Today, I work as a staff senior software engineer for Fairway Technologies in La Jolla, CA. I provide best in class software solutions to Fairway's clients utilizing all sorts of different technologies. More than anything though, I love building UI's and well architected front end applications in JavaScript, my favorite language.

In my spare time, I can often be found enjoying time with friends and family, playing hockey, or making music.
