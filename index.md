<h2>HI! MY NAME IS CRAIG <span class="responsive-line-break">AND I <span class="heart">â™¥</span> CODING!</span></h2>

I'm a full stack software engineer specializing in front end web development. Building cool things on the web has been an undying passion of mine for the last <span class="years">20</span> years.

I strive to build elegantly designed solutions while never losing sight of user experience or business goals. To acheive this, I keep up to date with the latest techniques and trends in web development and design.

Building standards compliant applications is important to me. Following web standards today means I'm coding for tomorrow's internet. I build maintainable applications that stay ahead of the technology curve.

Strict adherence to software development best practices allows me to push the boundaries of web technology while still delivering at the speed of business.
